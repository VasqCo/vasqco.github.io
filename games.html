                <p class="center-right">We have made a lot of video games in our time. Almost <em>too</em> many. But that's not going to stop us from making several more!<br>
                    You can check out our games on <a target="_blank" href="https://vasq-co.itch.io/">our itch page!</a>

                    <h3>Benry & Krimpst</h3>
                    <p>A classic setup, you see. A big guy and a smol guy. They are two brothers. One is a cripple, however. Use this to your advantage somehow.</p>
                    <a href="https://vasq-co.itch.io/benry-y-krimpst" target="_blank">Play it. Now.</a>

                    <h3>Super Cool Fighters</h3>
                    <p>A super original fighting game. Never been done before. If someone has made this kind of game before, we surely did it better. Play as characters from our other games. I know you've always wanted to kill them.</p>
                    <a href="https://vasq-co.itch.io/super-cool-fighters">Play this one. Now. Well, after you finish the last one. Then play this one.</a>

                    <h3>Hobo Horror 2</h3>
                    
                    <p>Have you ever seen a homeless person on the side of the road and thought to yourself any of the following?:<br><br>
                        1. Gosh dang! That thang is SCARY!<br>
                        2. Gosh dang! I want to DESTROY that thang!<br><br>
                        Then you'll probably hate this game, because they scare you and you can't kill them.</p>
                    <a href="https://vasq-co.itch.io/hobo-horror-2">Play this oneâ€¦ <em>if you daaaaaaare!</em></a>
