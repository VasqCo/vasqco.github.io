        <h1>Our Music</h1>
        <p>Over the last few years we've released four albums, three EPs, and six singles. let me now tell you about them listen to me talk about them and then listen to them. >:(</p>
        
        <h2>I Don't Even Care - 2024</h2>
        <img src="idec.png" alt="The album cover for I Don't Even Care. It's of a burning building." style="width: 500px;">
        <p>This is our third and best album probably it's so good. That's why I'm putting it up at the top. Because it's so good.</p>
        
        <h2>E/P - 2024</h2>
        <div>
            <img src="e.png" alt="The album cover for E." style="width: 500px; height: 500px;">
            <img src="p.png" alt="The album cover for P." style="width: 500px; height: 500px;">
        </div>
        <p>We each tasked ourselves with writing one EP each and we'd release them at the same time. Matt wrote P and Luke wrote E. One is way better than the other.</p>
        
        <h2>Another Christmas - 2025</h2>
        <img src="ac.png" alt="The album cover for Another Christmas." style="width: 500px;">
        <p>This is our fourth and worst album. We made it in like 2 days. Luke was like, "Wanna make a Christmas album?!?" and Matt was like "no." The rest is history.</p>
        
        <h2>Rock Music - 2023</h2>
        <img src="rm.png" alt="The album cover for Rock Music." style="width: 500px;">
        <p>Okay this was our first album and our ACTUAL worst album. I think like half the lyrics were AI generated it was not good. We've since learned to not do that. This one was interesting because it had an actual story, but it wasn't very interesting. We've tried to release music with a story since but we could never commit to it.</p>
        
        <p>Here are the Spotify and Apple Music for us please and thank you.</p>
